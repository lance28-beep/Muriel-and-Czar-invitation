  narrative: `Czar Alvin and Muriel Anne first crossed paths in 2014 during a college graduation
celebration held at the home of Christine—Czar’s friend and Muriel’s cousin. That day was
simple and fleeting, filled with nothing more than shy smiles and a polite “hi” and “hello.”
Little did they know, it was the quiet beginning of a story that would unfold years later.
In 2015, plans were made for them to meet again, with Christine happily trying to play
matchmaker. Time, however, had other plans. The meeting never happened, and despite
Christine’s playful teasing and encouragement, Muriel remained reserved, letting destiny
take its time. \n
Nearly nine years passed. \n
Then, on a bright and sunny day in February 2023, everything changed. Christine casually
called Czar and asked how he was doing. Before ending the call, she gave him a number
and told him to message it. What Czar didn’t know was that the number belonged to Muriel.
With a simple “hi” and “hello,” their long-awaited connection finally began.
From that moment on, conversations flowed effortlessly. Text messages turned into late-night
calls, and calls turned into video chats filled with laughter, stories, and growing affection.
Comfort slowly blossomed into something deeper and more meaningful. \n
Their first official meeting—and first date since reconnecting—happened on March 18, 2023.
From that day on, everything felt different—natural, genuine, and right. On April 1, 2023,
their bond became official. And On May 27, 2023, Muriel’s birthday It was a day that
confirmed what their hearts already knew: this was something special. \n
As time went on, Czar and Muriel spent the next two and a half years nurturing their
relationship, keeping the spark alive through love, care, patience, and mutual respect.
Distance never weakened their bond, even when Czar began working abroad. Instead, it
strengthened their commitment and their dreams for the future. \n
With hearts full of hope and love, they now look forward to 2026—the year they plan to tie
the knot, celebrate their journey, and begin a new chapter together as husband and wife,
ready to build a happy family grounded in love that waited patiently, but arrived right on time.`,
